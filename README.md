### 🧠 About Me
🎓 I’m currently pursuing my B.Tech in **Electronics & Communication Engineering**, blending the power of circuits and code to build meaningful, data-driven solutions.

💥 Whether it's **AI for financial risk mitigation**, **deep learning for emotion recognition**, or **web apps that empower users**, I love diving deep and delivering impact.

💼 **Beyond code**, I'm fascinated by real-world problem-solving — turning complex challenges into deployable solutions through creativity, logic, and collaboration.
